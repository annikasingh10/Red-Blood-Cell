# Red Blood Cell Detection and Classification

This Python project detects and classifies red blood cells in microscopy images, identifying cells infected with malaria based on grayscale value analysis.

## Features
- Uses Sobel edge detection for accurate red blood cell identification.
- Removes noise and parasitic interference for cleaner detection.
- Classifies infected cells based on pixel grayscale values and thresholds.
- Highlights infected cells in the final output image.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-image
- matplotlib
